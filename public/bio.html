<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Born in Madhya Pradesh , i am the younger child of the my parents. My father is a government employee 
  so we traveled a lot , from Kanpur to Bahadurgarh to Bhopal to Navi Mumbai to Lucknow and now back to Kanpur. I completed my 10 and 12 form 
  CBSE(year in which every central government HRD ministry want play Bigg Boss with student ). Even the teachers were 
  confused with grading system. Nevertheless i completed my 12th in 2013 and gave improvement again and secured 71%. 
  I did Engineering after my overly enthusiastic father forced me to do in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. 
  Fortunately, my the struggle changed to adventure because of my room mates and some individual that talked to me via facebook.
  I completed my Engineering in 2018, then started preparing for all government exam(you can name it ,i have given it or at 
  least filled the form). But nothing sparked so i started preparing for MTech (because they give stipend)and got selected in 2020, 
  but with the courtesy of China's Wuhan Lab i wasn't able to join college by the way i got selected in DTU, delhi. Currently i am in 
  Amazon as a Catalog Associate waiting for new opportunity.</p>
